    User profile:
        The User persona that I created for this CV is very loosely based on myself, combining both real and fake qualifications. That means that I didn't have to put much effort on creating a persona, since it's just basically me.

    Info aquitecture:
        I decided to place a portrait in the top left since it's the first place we usually look at when reading something, and since first impressions are important i think that the face of an applicant being the first thing you see makes it so companies will se you as more trustworthy, as opposed to hidding/not-including a portrait.
        I placed all the contact info on the top right, as I felt it was an unobtrusive spot to put it in, and also I think it balances the top bar by having elements on both sides.
        Then in the body of the page is where all relevant information is. each block preceded by a sort of header denoting which category the info following it belongs to.
        I left thw bottom row empty as I didn't feel the need to include any more information than the one I had already included, I thought about including the info about the personal vehicle and driver's licence on the bottom row, but in the end I considered that this info is relevant enough to some job offers as to be included amongst the main info, such as languages education and job history, which could be considered the most important information.

    Visual design: 
        For the color scheme I chose tones fo blue, using a darker tone for both the top and bottom row, an using a lighter tone for the main body of the page, In my Figma desing I heavily used gradients, which I didn't know how to implement in Html & CSS, that resulted in the actual website having a much less appealing color palette, which is a shame becaus I think the colors in my figma design, even though they could give the image of not being very professional (due to the use of gradients), are very pleasing to look at, and give a feeling of tranquility.
For the font at first I wanted to use Times New Roman, but it wasn't available in FIgma, so I used a very similar one, that being "Playfair Display", since I think it has the same advantatges as Times New Roman, in the sense that it's clean and professional while also not being boring to look at, unlike arial.
Most of the text is in black, this was a fairly obvious design choice, since the main body has a very light background color, making black the prime color for the text, I also like to avoid colored text so something like dark blue was out of the question. as for the name in the CV I used White since I think it contrasts nicely against the dark blue collor of the top row.
